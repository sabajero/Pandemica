# Pandemica
A repository to storage my Bachelor Thesis work.

In my degree work, titled “Pandémica”, **I present a research-creation project that reflects on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on my daily life in the Colombian cities of Cali and Buga**. **I use the Artist's Book (Libro-arte) as the primary artistic medium for this exploration**.

My research addresses the problem of expressing the significant personal and social impact of the pandemic through art, while also aiming to contribute to the academic archive of visual arts regarding the pandemic in the region. I noted a lack of accessible academic information on Artist's Books and pandemics in general.

The **main objective** of my thesis is **to reflect on the changes in my personal daily life caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Cali and Buga through the creation of an Artist's Book, thereby contributing to the academic discussion on this historical event in visual arts**. My specific objectives include:

*   Demonstrating the importance of artistic creation and images in past pandemics through bibliographic review.
*   Showcasing the historical, conceptual, and artistic approaches to the Artist's Book.
*   Presenting the process and final results of the physical and virtual Artist's Book that visually reflects on my personal effects of the pandemic in Cali and Buga.

My thesis includes a **review of literature** on the art of past pandemics such as the Black Death, Cholera, Spanish Flu, and HIV/AIDS, examining their metaphors and effects on daily life. I also explore the history and conceptualization of the Artist's Book as an artistic genre, highlighting its potential for non-linear narratives and personal expression. The literature review further examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life, including the "new normal" and the increased digitisation of social interactions. I point out a gap in academic research specifically addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and daily life through the lens of the Artist's Book.

The **methodology** I employed is a combination of bibliographic research and research-creation in the visual arts. The bibliographic research involved reviewing literature on art and pandemics, as well as on the history and theory of the Artist's Book. The research-creation component involved collecting sensitive data through conversations with participants in Cali, a focus group, and my personal logbook. This process informed the creation of an earlier project, "Ahora sin cielo abierto" (Now without open sky), which consisted of watercolours reflecting the experiences of young people in Cali during the pandemic. The culmination of this process is the Artist's Book, "PANDEMICA", which uses drawings and paintings to reflect on my personal experiences and those of my close ones in Cali and Buga during the pandemic.

I detail my **personal research-creation process**, starting with initial photographic documentation of the early quarantine in Cali. This evolved into digital and physical drawings, as well as photographic records of the deserted cityscapes. The "Ahora sin cielo abierto" project is described in detail, outlining its methodology for collecting sensitive data and creating watercolours based on the shared experiences of young people in Cali. Finally, I discuss the creation of the Artist's Book "PANDEMICA", which uses a non-mimetic style inspired by illustrators like Shaun Tan to reflect on the pandemic from a personal perspective, incorporating themes of isolation, altered routines, and family experiences in both Cali and Buga.

In the **conclusions**, I state that my research demonstrates the fundamental role of visual arts in understanding pandemics throughout history, serving as historical documents and tools for coping and imagining their effects. I highlight the Artist's Book as a versatile and intimate medium for exploring complex themes like trauma and illness, making it suitable for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic on both public and personal levels. My research also concludes that research-creation is a powerful method for obtaining sensitive data and generating artistic insights that go beyond the artist's personal perspective.
